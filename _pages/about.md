I'm just a simple Acpuncturist who loves doing this. Acupuncture is easy, as long as you have a place to lie down comfortably in your place, I could come and do it. Acupuncture could help with a lot of things, according of the regulation, I cannot use the word 'fix'. Anyway, acupuncture is acutally one of the mainstream medicine in China for thousands of years, it's pretty good for all sorts of injuries; post-op recoveries; fracture recoveries; post stroke recoveries, headaches, migraines, mental issues like anxiety, early stage dimension, young kids with autism, PTSD; nerve damage recoveries; fertility, period issues, menopause symptoms; athma, eczma, hayfever; abstinence syndrome from drugs, smoke, alcohol, ect.; I can go on and on and on, of course i could not fix all of that, but I will definately be able to help a lot with so many things. 
And I have really good knowledge of Chinese herbal Medicine as well. But unfortunately, herbal medicine are pretty expensive and not covered by insurance and tastes disgusting and some herbs are not available in NZ and... And I just end up using herbs mostly on myself and my family & friends. Just letting you that you have another option.
If you have a very long term stuff, feel free to email me with the information about it as detailed as you can, I will possibly be able to let you know how much i might be able to help you with by replying your email
