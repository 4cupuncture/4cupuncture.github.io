I'm just a simple Acpuncturist who loves doing this. I will come to your place in the evenings if you are around my area. Acupuncture is easy, as long as you have a place to lie down comfortably in your place, I could come and do it. Acupuncture could help with a lot of things, according of the regulation, I cannot use the word 'fix'. Anyway, acupuncture is acutally one of the mainstream medicine in China for thousands of years, it's pretty good for all sorts of injuries; post-op recoveries; fracture recoveries; post stroke recoveries, headaches, migraines, mental issues like anxiety, early stage dimension, young kids with autism, PTSD; nerve damage recoveries; fertility, period issues, menopause symptoms; athma, eczma, hayfever; abstinence syndrome from drugs, smoke, alcohol, ect.; I can go on and on and on, of course i could not fix all of that, but I will be able to help a lot with so many things. Feel free to email me.

And I have really good knowledge of Chinese herbal Medicine as well. But unfortunately, herbal medicine are pretty expensive and not covered by insurance and tastes disgusting and some herbs are not available in NZ and... And I just end up using herbs mostly on myself and my family & friends. Just letting you that you have another option.

$10 surcharge under a valid ACC number (It usually means the injury happened within a year); Without ACC the Charge is $120 initially, and $60 follow-ups. Sessions usually last for 45-90 minutes. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com).
